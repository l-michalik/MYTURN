### Iteration Prompting Guidelines

**80% is:**
- **Task** → Clearly state what you want.  
  *Example: "Summarize this report in 5 bullet points."*  

- **Context** → Provide background or purpose.  
  *Example: "The report is for a business meeting with non-technical managers."*  

- **References** → Share examples, formats, or prior outputs.  
  *Example: "Follow the style of the summary from last week."*  

- **Evaluate** → Check if the answer meets the goal.  
  *Example: "Does this summary avoid technical jargon?"*  

- **Iterate** → Refine the prompt based on results.  
  *Example: "Make it even shorter and add a key takeaway."*  


**20% is:**
- **Revisit the prompting framework**  
  Provide more context and examples.  
  *Example: Instead of "Summarize this report in 5 bullet points," → "Summarize this report in 5 bullet points for a business meeting with non-technical managers, following the style of last week’s summary."*  

- **Use shorter sentences**  
  Break instructions into simple steps.  
  *Example: Instead of "Summarize this report for a business meeting," → "First, summarize the report in 5 bullet points. Then, highlight 1 key takeaway for managers."*  

- **Experiment with phrasing**  
  Try alternative wording or analogous tasks.  
  *Example: Instead of "Summarize this report in 5 bullet points," → "Explain the report’s key points as if you were preparing speaking notes for a CEO."*  

- **Introduce constraints**  
  Add boundaries to keep focus.  
  *Example: "Summarize the report in exactly 5 bullet points, using plain language with no technical jargon."*
